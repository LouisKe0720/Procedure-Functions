# Parameter Passing is when passing input parameters into a function and and receiving the results back. Parameters are the things between the "()" in a function. Ex. def add_numbers(num1, num2):. num1 and num2 are the parameters. Arguments are the values that are passed into the parameters. Ex. add_numbers(5, 10). 5 and 10 are the arguments.
